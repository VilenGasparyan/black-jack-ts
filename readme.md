## 🎮 How to Play

- **Objective**: Get a hand total as close to 21 as possible without going over.
- **Player Actions**:
  - `hit`: Draw another card.
  - `stand`: Keep your current hand.
  - `double`: Double your bet, draw one more card, and then stand.
  - `split`: If you have two of the same cards, you can split them into two hands (advanced). (on development)
- **Dealer Rules**: The dealer must hit until their cards total 16 or higher.

## 🃏 Features

- **Realistic Gameplay**: Mimics real Blackjack rules.
- **Interactive Commands**: Easy-to-use CLI commands for a smooth gaming experience.
- **Randomized Deck**: Each game starts with a freshly shuffled deck for fairness.

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

- Always assume the dealer's hidden card is a 10.
- Never split 10s – you already have a great hand!
- Use doubling down strategically to maximize your winnings.
